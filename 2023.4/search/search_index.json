Capable users with some experience can be up and running in a handful of minutes - don't panic if it takes you a little more time, especially if you've not used Linux or HPC research environments before. Firstly - don't worry that you might break something complicated and expensive; one of the joys of having your own personal environment is that no one will tell you that you're doing it wrong, and nothing is at risk of being broken, aside from the data and work you've done yourself in the environment.</p> <p>We encourage new users to run through a few tutorials in this documentation - even if you have plenty of HPC experience. Technology moves forward all the time and new features are constantly popping up that could save you effort in future. If you do run into problems, try replicating the steps you went through to get where you are - sometimes a typo in a command early-on in your workflow might not cause any errors until right at the end of your work. It can help to work collaboratively with other researchers running similar jobs - not only are two sets of eyes better than one, you'll both get something out of working together to achieve a shared goal.</p> <p>For software application support you're going to need to contact the developers of the packages themselves. Remember that many of these software products are open-source and you've paid no fee to use them - try to make your bug-reports and enhancement requests as helpful and friendly as possible to the application developers. They've done you a great service by making their software available for you to use - please be respectful of their time and effort if you need to contact them, and remember to credit their software in your research publications.</p>"},{"location":"overview/glossary/","title":"Glossary","text":"<p>This glossary provides a starting point for understanding key terms in the field of HPC. It's important to note that HPC is a rapidly evolving domain, and new technologies and concepts continually emerge.</p> High-Performance Computing (HPC) <p>HPC refers to the use of powerful computing systems and infrastructure to solve complex computational problems that require significant processing power, memory, and parallelization.</p> Cluster <p>A cluster is a group of interconnected computers or servers that work together as a single system to provide increased computing capabilities. In HPC, clusters are commonly used to distribute workloads across multiple nodes.</p> Node <p>A node is an individual computer or server within a cluster. Each node typically consists of multiple processing cores, memory, storage, and networking capabilities.</p> <p>Supercomputer: A supercomputer is an extremely powerful and high-performance computer system designed to solve complex computational problems. Supercomputers are often used for scientific simulations, weather forecasting, molecular modeling, and other computationally intensive tasks.</p> <p>Parallel Computing: Parallel computing involves dividing a computational task into smaller subtasks that can be executed simultaneously across multiple processing units (such as cores or nodes) to achieve faster execution times.</p> <p>MPI (Message Passing Interface): MPI is a standard programming interface used for developing parallel applications in distributed-memory systems, such as HPC clusters. It provides a set of communication routines that allow processes to exchange data and coordinate their execution.</p> <p>OpenMP: OpenMP is an application programming interface (API) that supports shared-memory parallel programming. It allows developers to parallelize their code by using compiler directives and runtime library calls to distribute work across multiple cores within a single node.</p> <p>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): A GPU is a specialized hardware component designed for parallel processing. GPUs excel at performing complex mathematical computations and are widely used in HPC for accelerating scientific simulations, deep learning, and data-intensive tasks.</p> <p>InfiniBand: InfiniBand is a high-speed networking technology commonly used in HPC clusters. It provides low-latency and high-bandwidth interconnectivity between nodes, enabling efficient communication and data transfer.</p> <p>Job Scheduler: A job scheduler is a software component that manages the allocation of computational resources in an HPC environment. It schedules and prioritizes jobs submitted by users, taking into account resource availability, job dependencies, and user-defined policies.</p> <p>Petascale Computing: Petascale computing refers to systems capable of performing computations at a scale of one quadrillion (10^15) calculations per second. These systems have massive computational power and are used for tackling extremely large and complex problems.</p> <p>Scalability: Scalability refers to the ability of an HPC system to efficiently handle larger workloads as the problem size or the number of processing units increases. A scalable system exhibits consistent performance improvements without significant degradation.</p> <p>Benchmark: A benchmark is a standardized test or workload used to measure and compare the performance of HPC systems. It helps evaluate the computational capabilities of different systems, software optimizations, and algorithmic efficiency.</p> <p>Lustre: Lustre is an open-source parallel file system commonly used in HPC environments. It provides high-performance storage capabilities, allowing large-scale data access and parallel I/O for distributed applications.</p> <p>Checkpointing: Checkpointing involves saving the state of an executing application at specific intervals to disk. It enables resuming computations from the last saved checkpoint in case of system failures or interruptions, reducing the need to restart computations from the beginning.</p> <p>Task Parallelism: Task parallelism involves dividing a computational problem into smaller independent tasks that can be executed concurrently. Each task operates on a separate portion of the data, enabling efficient utilization of multiple processing units.</p> <p>Grid Computing: Grid computing is a distributed computing model that allows resources from multiple HPC clusters or institutions to be pooled together to solve large-scale problems. It provides a framework for sharing computing power and data across geographically dispersed systems.</p> <p>Moore's Law: Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years, resulting in exponential growth in computational power. This observation has driven the advancement of HPC by enabling increasingly powerful processors and improved performance.</p> <p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD): CFD is a branch of engineering that uses numerical methods and algorithms to simulate and analyze fluid flow and heat transfer. HPC plays a crucial role in CFD simulations, allowing engineers to model and optimize complex fluid dynamics problems.</p> <p>Big Data Analytics: Big data analytics refers to the process of extracting insights, patterns, and trends from large and complex datasets. HPC systems are often used to process and analyze massive amounts of data quickly, enabling efficient data-driven decision-making.</p>"},{"location":"overview/prerequisites/","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>You're going to need access to some computers. If you already have access to cloud resources, then great - you're ready to go. There are some specific requirements depending on your platform type, which are discussed in the relevant chapters of this guide.</p> <p>You'll need a client device - something to log into your research environment from. The requirements on client devices are fairly minimal, but you'll need:  - A computer with a screen and a keyboard; you can probably access on a tablet or smartphone too, if your typing is good enough  - A relatively modern web-browser; Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and pretty much anything else that was written/updated in the last couple of years should all be fine.  - An SSH client; this comes built-in for Linux and Mac based machines, but you'll need to install one for Windows clients and some tablets.  - Internet access; it seems dumb to list this as a requirement for running HPC on cloud resources, but a surprising number of sites actually limit outbound connectivity to the Internet. You'll need to be able to access the Internet from your client device.  - Optionally: A graphical data transfer tool; you don't actually need one of these, but they can really help new users get started more quickly.</p> <p>It's worth checking for centrally-managed client systems that you can install the software that you need - some research sites don't allow users to install new software. Here are some recommendations of software that you can use on client machines; this is far from a complete list, but should help you get started:</p> <ul> <li>SSH client:<ul> <li>Use the built-in <code>ssh</code> client for Mac and Linux</li> <li>For Windows, try Putty or SmaTTY</li> </ul> </li> <li>Web-browser:<ul> <li>Use the built-in Safari browser on Macs</li> <li>For Linux and Windows, install Firefox or Chrome</li> </ul> </li> <li>VNC (Graphical desktop client):<ul> <li>Use the built-in VNC client on Macs</li> <li>For Linux, install \"vncviewer\" package, or install RealVNC viewer</li> <li>For Windows, install TurboVNC</li> </ul> </li> <li>Graphical file-transfer tools:<ul> <li>For Macs and Linux, install Cyberduck or Filezilla</li> <li>For Windows, try WinSCP, Cyberduck or Filezilla</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>We've tried to make recommendations for open-source and/or free software client software here - as ever, please read and obey the licensing terms, and try to contribute to the supporting projects either financially, or by referencing them in your research publications.</p>"}]}
