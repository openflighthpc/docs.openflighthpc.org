# Flight Solo

## What is Flight Solo?

Flight Solo is a preloaded, HPC-ready, platform-agnostic image approach to deploying HPC resources.

Flight Solo provides a personal High Performance Computing (HPC) environment for research and scientific computing. Compatible with on-demand, reserved and spot instances, Flight Solo rapidly delivers a whole HPC software environment, ready to go and complete with job scheduler, applications and remote desktop service. Multiple software application frameworks are available for use including SPack, Easybuild and Conda containing many hundreds of different programs, libraries, compilers and MPIs.
