# Obtaining the Flight Environment

There are a few options for obtaining the Flight Environment, some of the methods will be covered within this documentation:

**From the [OpenFlight Repository](https://repo.openflighthpc.org)**
: Prebuilt RPMs and DEB packages are built and maintained by the project, this is the recommended way of installing Flight on an existing system.

**Through the [Flight Solo image](../../flight-solo/index.md)**
: For those utilising public and/or private cloud, the Flight Solo image provides a preconfigured OS loaded with the OpenFlight tools and useful extra hooks to get you started with HPC deployment quickly.

**Downloading the source code**
: Every project is available in the OpenFlight GitHub organisation, the very latest changes are available here however it is **not recommended** to build it from source for general usage. The source code is subject to frequent changes and won't be vigorously tested until just before packaging and releasing in the repository.
