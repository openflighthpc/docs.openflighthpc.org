# Flight Desktop

Your Flight User Suite login node can run graphical desktop sessions to support users who want to run interactive applications across the research environment. The system can support a number of different sessions simultaneously, and allow multiple remote participants to connect to the same session to support training and collaborative activities. This section of the documentation describes how to setup and use this tool.

!!! tip
    The [Flight Web Suite](../../flight-web-suite/flight-desktop.md) provides an alternative method for managing desktop sessions in the HPC environment.
