# Copying Data to a HPC Environment

Many compute workloads involve processing data on the research environment - users often need to copy data files to the research environment for processing, and retrieve processed data and results afterwards. This documentation describes a number of methods of working with data on your research environment, depending on how users prefer to transfer it.

Later in the documentation a method to move data using the [Flight Web Suite](/flight-environment/usage/flight-web-suite/file-manager) will be described.
