# Prerequisites

You're going to need access to some computers. If you already have access to cloud resources, then great - you're ready to go. There are some specific requirements depending on your platform type, which are discussed in the relevant chapters of this guide.

You'll need a client device - something to log into your research environment from. The requirements on client devices are fairly minimal, but you'll need:
 - **A computer with a screen and a keyboard**; you can probably access on a tablet or smartphone too, if your typing is good enough
 - **A relatively modern web-browser**; Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and pretty much anything else that was written/updated in the last couple of years should all be fine.
 - **An SSH client**; this comes built-in for Linux and Mac based machines, but you'll need to install one for Windows clients and some tablets.
 - **Internet access**; it seems dumb to list this as a requirement for running HPC on cloud resources, but a surprising number of sites actually limit outbound connectivity to the Internet. You'll need to be able to access the Internet from your client device.
 - *Optionally:* **A graphical data transfer tool**; you don't actually need one of these, but they can really help new users get started more quickly.


It's worth checking for centrally-managed client systems that you can install the software that you need - some research sites don't allow users to install new software. Here are some recommendations of software that you can use on client machines; this is far from a complete list, but should help you get started:

 - SSH client:
    - Use the built-in `ssh` client for Mac and Linux
    - For Windows, try [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) or [SmaTTY](http://smartty.sysprogs.com/)
 - Web-browser:
    - Use the built-in Safari browser on Macs
    - For Linux and Windows, install [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
 - VNC (Graphical desktop client):
    - Use the built-in VNC client on Macs
    - For Linux, install "vncviewer" package, or install [RealVNC viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/linux/)
    - For Windows, install [TurboVNC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/)
 - Graphical file-transfer tools:
    - For Macs and Linux, install [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) or [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
    - For Windows, try [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/), [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) or [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

We've tried to make recommendations for open-source and/or free software client software here - as ever, please read and obey the licensing terms, and try to contribute to the supporting projects either financially, or by referencing them in your research publications.
