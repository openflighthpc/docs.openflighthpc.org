As an alternative to copying data back to your client machine, users may prefer to upload their data to a cloud-based object storage service instead. Cloud storage solutions such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [SWIFT](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift) have command-line tools which can be used to connect existing cloud storage to your research environment. Benefits of using an object-based storage service include:

- Data is kept safe and does not have to be independently backed-up
- Storage is easily scalable, with the ability for data to grow to practically any size
- You only pay for what you use; you do not need to buy expansion room in advance
- Storage service providers often have multiple tiers available, helping to reduce the cost of storing data
- Data storage and retrieval times may be improved, as storage service providers typically have more bandwidth than individual sites
- Your company, institution or facility may receive some storage capacity for free which you could use

Object storage is particularly useful for archiving data, as it typically provides a convenient, accessible method of storing data which may need to be shared with a wide group of individuals.
