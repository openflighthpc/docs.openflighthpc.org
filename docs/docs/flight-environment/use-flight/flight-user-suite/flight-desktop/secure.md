# Securing your Desktop Session

As the VNC protocol does not natively provide support for security protocols such as SSL, you may wish to take steps to secure access to your VNC sessions.

Several third party tools exist to help you secure your VNC connections.  One option is *ssvnc*, available [here](http://ssvnc.sourceforge.net/).

Alternatively, you could use an SSH tunnel to access your session. Refer to online guides for setup instructions.
