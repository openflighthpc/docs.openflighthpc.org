# Getting Flight Solo

Flight Solo is platform-agnostic so is likely to be available for the cloud provider you use. Currently the Flight Solo image is built & tested on AWS, Azure, OpenStack and Concertim Cloud. Further to the image being made available, it can also be launched through the [AWS Marketplace](https://alces-flight.com/solo/aws).

This section details how to obtain and import the Flight Solo image into the supported platforms.
