# Deploying Minio in Kubernetes

To deploy Minio in our Kubernetes cluster, we utilize Helm charts. Prior to installation, it's crucial to ensure that the Helm CLI is properly set up and the kubeconfig file is located in the designated directory.

For this installation, we've opted for the default namespace, employing the following configurations:

- storageClass:  
- Minio rootUser
- Minio rootPassword
- Minio ServiceType
- Minio API port
- Minio console port

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

helm install -n default  --set global.storageClass=longhorn --set auth.rootUser=admin --set auth.rootPassword=test123456 --set service.type=NodePort --set service.nodePorts.api=31100 --set service.nodePorts.console=31101 --set persistence.size=2Gi my-minio bitnami/minio --version 12.9.4
```

## Accessing Minio Console

After the installation process concludes, the Minio console becomes accessible via the URL `http://<k8s-master-node-ip>:<console-nodeort-value>`. For instance, if the Kubernetes master node IP is 11.11.11.34 and the console node port value is 31101, the URL will be `http://11.11.11.34:31101`.

It's important to note that all Kubernetes workloads will employ the Minio API port for uploading their results to the Minio storage system. This seamless integration ensures a streamlined process for storing and managing workload outcomes.
